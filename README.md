# Sudoku
Creating and Solving Sudoku. Must have GUI representation.
So far there is a python code that can be used for solving a given SUDOKU.

TODO: Create a GUI representation for the solving.
The idea is to show how the PC solves the SUDOKU by inserting each number into the cells and proceeding with whatever satisfies with the conditions.
It should also show backtracking incase no solution is found for the current table.

TODO: Write code to generate random SUDOKU.
The idea is to create a solved sudoku and remove numbers from it randomly and try to see if the given sudoku is solvable or not.

TODO: Write a GUI representation for the creation of SUDOKU
The sudoku shows up as solved and then random numbers vansh from the GUI to display blanks. 
The effect has to be fast so that the user can't see/ remeber the solution.
